Cases where libraries are not installed:
- Throw bad error message
- Should be the developer's duty to set up their environment properly with the libraries they want to use
- Add to pytest configuration file

Devices would eventually be moved out of constructor
For differential tests, we would introduce diff_input function

diff_given():
- Parameters:
- Specific
-- Passes in differential test inputs
-- Want to eliminate the devices constructor; devices would only support specific inputs
-- Supports any differential input variable to be given
--- Example: testing on devices, written as diff_given(devices, ["cuda", "cpu"])
--- Reference how given is written right now
-- Would be from the inline test call itself
-- Devices is only accepted first argument in diff_given
--- Should be equivalent to what it was
--- Can try to extend for any first argument
-- Can be used together with given()
--- Some variables shouldn't be given multiple values; not changing the values of multiple inputs
--- Use given() to specific input value for some variables
--- Use diff_given() for inputs that need to be varied
-- Refer to project proposal for format
-- Order can be varied
