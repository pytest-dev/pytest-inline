Split progress so far, and push each as a separate request:
- Constructor
- Imports
- Diff Given

-Start another fork on the original pytest-inline repo
-Put constructor changes onto new fork
-Push request
-Repeat for other two components

Diff Given:
- Multiple scenes to worry about
- May need to up the best version, then develop off that

Clean up as separate requests, push them, then add more concrete tests for more inline tests
- More tests from constructor to inline
